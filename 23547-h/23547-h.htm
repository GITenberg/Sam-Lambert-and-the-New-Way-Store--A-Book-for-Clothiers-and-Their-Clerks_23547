	<h2 id="chapter_i"><a class="pagenum" id="page3" title="3"></a>CHAPTER I.</h2>

	<p><span class="first_word">Sam Lambert</span> had the best clothing store in Medeena County&#8212;a corner
	store on the main street of Medeena opposite the Court House Square.</p>

	<p>Medeena had four clothing stores, not counting The Blue Front, down by
	the Depot, with its collection of cheap watches in the window, a
	yellow guitar, two large accordions and a fiddle with a broken E
	string.</p>

	<p>Everybody in the County knew Sam Lambert.</p>

	<p>As a merchant and a citizen he was a whole bunch of live <a class="pagenum" id="page4" title="4"></a>wires. A
	big-boned, free-hearted fellow&#8212;lucky enough to just escape being run
	for sheriff, as some thought he was too good natured, the &#8220;gang&#8221; was
	afraid he was not pliant enough, and Sam didn&#8217;t want to be away from
	the store.</p>

	<p>Sam took great pride in his clothing business and kept pace with the
	most advanced ideas in the trade.</p>

	<p>He was awake to the marvelous development of the ready-to-wear
	business. He carried the best and took a positive delight in each
	season&#8217;s new models.</p>

	<p>He recalled the old days of &#8220;hand-me-downs,&#8221; and he had lived to see
	the two best tailors <a class="pagenum" id="page5" title="5"></a>in Medeena take to bushelling &#8220;ready&#8221; garments,
	with less and less of that to be done&#8212;principally changing a button
	or shortening a trouser&#8217;s length.</p>

	<p>Sam was broad-gauge in everything he did. He sold his goods at the
	marked price, for cash only&#8212;got a decent profit and told you so.</p>

	<p>Why shouldn&#8217;t he? He had a sense of style. He was keenly alive to the
	artistry of clothes and his enthusiasm was contagious.</p>

	<p>Sam was firmly convinced that a man has to spend money to make money
	in the clothing business.</p>

	<p>He said that a part of the value you deliver to a customer <a class="pagenum" id="page6" title="6"></a>consists in giving him a better opinion of himself: making him
	feel like a king for a day and that the best is none too good for him.</p>

	<p>&#8220;A store&#8221;, he would tell the boys, &#8220;cannot be run on the low gear. You
	must keep her keyed up. Relax when the store is empty, but when you go
	to meet a customer put on the tension&#8212;take a brace&#8212;get spring into
	your step&#8212;learn to bunch your vitality and get it across. But keep
	your energy inside.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t bounce and don&#8217;t talk too much. Keep yourself in hand. Be quiet
	but alert.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Concentrate! For the time being there is but one <a class="pagenum" id="page7" title="7"></a>person in
	the world and that is the customer, and the most interesting thing in
	life is the thing he came in to see.</p>

	<p>&#8220;You can size up your man while you are going forward to meet him. But
	by all means take him easy. Undue interest might embarrass him.
	Suppose he only wants a pair of 15c. socks; if he does, there is a
	test of your ability that you may not realize.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Many a clerk who can close a Twenty dollar transaction with tact and
	dispatch never seems able to handle a Ten cent sale so that the
	customer goes out feeling pleased with himself.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Nine men out of ten who come into the store are self-conscious. <a class="pagenum" id="page8" title="8"></a>The thing to do is to make your man feel that his requirement is
	important simply because it is his requirement.</p>

	<p>&#8220;A good salesman keeps his own personality in the background: he keeps
	the store and the sale in the background. He puts all the emphasis on
	service to the customer, and to do this he must mentally put himself
	in the customer&#8217;s place.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Try to be as interested in the customer&#8217;s finding what he wants as if
	the article was for yourself; but don&#8217;t insist on his taking only the
	thing that appeals to you.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Quietly dominate the sale, but leave him plenty of room <a class="pagenum" id="page9" title="9"></a>for
	the exercise of his own taste and ideas.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Most men, though they may not show it, are slightly on the defensive
	when they come into a clothing store. That is why it is so very
	important that there be no talking or laughing among the clerks.</p>

	<p>&#8220;You may find it hard to realize the effect of a whisper or a titter
	on the part of the store&#8217;s help when a customer is present. In nearly
	every case the man becomes sensitive or resentful and thinks he is
	being ridiculed.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Try it yourself sometime by going into a strange store in another
	line of business in a distant city: when you hear <a class="pagenum" id="page10" title="10"></a>a laugh or a
	remark passed among the clerks, see if you don&#8217;t wonder if there isn&#8217;t
	something wrong with your clothes or feel sure that comment is being
	made on your appearance or behavior.</p>

	<p>&#8220;There is another form of impatience or self-consciousness on the part
	of a customer who is more or less acquainted with the store. He
	hurries past everyone in front, headed for the part of the store where
	he thinks the goods he wants are kept.</p>

	<p>&#8220;It is bad policy to step in front of him or otherwise impede his
	progress. If there is no one to wait on him follow quietly and be on
	hand when he lands at his destination.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page11" title="11"></a>&#8220;A clerk often wonders why customers persist in doing this.</p>

	<p>&#8220;It is because they have an idea of the location of what they want and
	blindly strike out for it with a certain nervous desire to cover the
	intermediate ground as quickly as possible.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Remember that while you feel perfectly at home in the store, few
	customers do. It is your business to put them at ease and certainly to
	do nothing to make them uncomfortable.</p>

	<p>&#8220;When a man comes in for a suit of clothes he usually has some sort of
	a mental picture of the thing he desires. An idea, clearly defined or
	hazy, <a class="pagenum" id="page12" title="12"></a>is in his mind as to the general color and effect of the
	suit he wants.</p>

	<p>&#8220;It is something he has noticed worn by someone else&#8212;looked at in a
	show window, or seen in an illustration.</p>

	<p>&#8220;In most cases it will not be the thing he finally buys. It may be a
	chalk-line stripe or a Shepherd&#8217;s Plaid worn by a drummer who boarded
	the 6.30 Lightning Express. In the glow of the lamps and the bustle
	and excitement of the Station platform the thing looked possible: but
	confronted in the store with the very style and pattern he backs away
	from it, though &#8216;it looked good on the other man.&#8217;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Find out what he has in <a class="pagenum" id="page13" title="13"></a>mind; meet it as nearly as you can and get it out of the way.
	Otherwise he will not concentrate on other goods. He will hold to this
	mental picture and measure everything you show him by it&#8212;much to your
	disadvantage.</p>

	<p>&#8220;One of the worst possible things is to ask a man about what price
	suit he wants.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Keep price in the background. Time enough to feel him out on that
	subject. No man likes to have you take the measure of his pocket-book.</p>

	<p>&#8220;You must use your judgment in gauging him as to what to show him.</p>

	<p>&#8220;The important thing is to get at the picture he has in <a class="pagenum" id="page14" title="14"></a>mind, and the price too, if you can do so without asking him to name
	the figure.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Never ask a customer how he liked the last suit you sold him. Let
	by-gones be by-gones. This is a new deal. Whether he was entirely
	satisfied is not the point now. Don&#8217;t raise dangerous questions.</p>

	<p>&#8220;There are a dozen reasons why his last purchase may not be remembered
	with pleasure&#8212;reasons that have nothing to do with the value he
	received or the actual merit of the clothes.</p>

	<p>&#8220;If he voluntarily mentions the last suit with praise take it as a
	natural occurrence and pass <a class="pagenum" id="page15" title="15"></a>it over; you will try to do even better by him this time.</p>

	<p>&#8220;If he complains of his last purchase don&#8217;t argue. Leave the subject
	as soon as possible and get down to the question in hand.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Have confidence in your goods, in your prices and in yourself as a
	salesman.</p>

	<p>&#8220;There are more sales lost for lack of firmness and decision at the
	right time than for any other cause.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Among the clerks in the best and biggest of stores there are ten good
	openers of a sale to one good closer.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Be a closer.</p>

	<p>&#8220;It requires judgment and decision of character, but you can learn to
	do it.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page16" title="16"></a>&#8220;When a woman goes into a cloak and suit department, she is not
	satisfied to buy until she has been made to feel that she has pretty
	well canvassed the assortment, seen practically everything in the
	stock at the range and along the line she is seeking.</p>

	<p>&#8220;She has merchandise imagination and thinks of the possible garments
	back there in the stock that she might have liked better.</p>

	<p>&#8220;In this regard a man is somewhat easier to handle.</p>

	<p>&#8220;It is a fact often demonstrated that clerks can close a sale more
	quickly where the stock is kept on hangers instead of piled on tables.</p>

	<p>&#8220;The preliminaries are <a class="pagenum" id="page17" title="17"></a>more quickly covered. Having walked down the line the customer is
	better satisfied that the whole selection is placed at his disposal.</p>

	<p>&#8220;There is no secret about it. Nothing held back. No mysterious pile of
	garments on a table that he cannot see.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Note the tendency of the customer to investigate a pile of
	coats&#8212;lifting up the corners and looking at the patterns.</p>

	<p>&#8220;A coat in plain view, taken off the hanger, is more obviously a
	thoughtful selection of a garment definitely suited for him and he is
	the more ready to make it his own.</p>

	<p>&#8220;The important thing in closing a sale is to narrow down the choice as
	soon as <a class="pagenum" id="page18" title="18"></a>you can to one or two strong possibilities, flanked by a bad one&#8212;that
	is, a style or a pattern that you know the customer doesn&#8217;t want.</p>

	<p>&#8220;When this point is reached it is well to move the customer away from
	the rest of the stock, say to some distant corner where he can stand
	on a rug and look in the mirror&#8212;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Where his whole attention can be given to one suit, or at most a
	choice between two.</p>

	<p>&#8220;A sale must be opened easily. The customer should never be made to
	feel that he is being restricted in his selection. But the moment you
	can form an idea of what he wants you can probably think of just the
	thing for him.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page19" title="19"></a>&#8220;If you handle him right he accepts your knowledge of the assortment,
	instead of demanding a complete canvass of the stock.</p>

	<p>&#8220;It is then you may know that you have established his confidence.</p>

	<p>&#8220;In a comparatively short time you can narrow him down to a choice
	where by a tactful show of firmness you can help him decide.</p>

	<p>&#8220;In the handling of almost every sale there is a point beyond which
	the customer begins to flounder and show indecision.</p>

	<p>&#8220;The weak salesman leads him on and on with no stopping point&#8212;no
	place to close&#8212;and the prospective sale fades <a class="pagenum" id="page20" title="20"></a>to a &#8216;just looking today&#8217; excuse.</p>

	<p>&#8220;This is a universal fault among retail clerks.</p>

	<p>&#8220;The test of salesmanship is in closing a sale.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Be a closer!</p>

	<p>&#8220;Never guy a customer or &#8216;kid him along&#8217; for the amusement of a
	by-stander or a fellow clerk. This is a common practice in some
	clothing stores. The offender is usually a self-satisfied clerk who
	has had just enough success as a salesman to make him egotistical.</p>

	<p>&#8220;He thinks he is a regular dare-devil and that by making sport of his
	customer he may win a reputation as the village cut-up. His favorite
	victim is <a class="pagenum" id="page21" title="21"></a>some half-witted fellow&#8212;tho&#8217; a customer who is partly deaf may do and
	he is always ready for a yokel or a foreigner.</p>

	<p>&#8220;There is no doubt,&#8221; said Sam Lambert, &#8220;that the medal for the longest
	ears and the loudest bray in the clothing business belongs to this
	Smart Aleck type of clerk known as a &#8216;kidder&#8217;.</p>

	<p>&#8220;To say nothing of the respect he owes the customer, it is astonishing
	how he can presume to work his cheap little side-play on any human
	being, when even a dog is sensitive to ridicule and knows when he is
	being laughed at.&#8221;</p>

	<!-- <a class="pagenum" id="page22" title="22"></a> [Blank Page]-->

	<h2 id="chapter_ii"><a class="pagenum" id="page23" title="23"></a>CHAPTER II.</h2>

	<p><span class="first_word">No</span> one questioned Sam Lambert&#8217;s power as a business getter, nor the
	alertness of his store-keeping methods.</p>

	<p>He was prodigal of his own energy&#8212;never spared himself. He looked
	after the important things and left details to others.</p>

	<p>As with every man who is a constructive force in the world of affairs,
	Sam&#8217;s friends and relatives shook their heads&#8212;said that he needed a
	balance-wheel.</p>

	<p>This was dinned into his ears so often that he finally <a class="pagenum" id="page24" title="24"></a>came to believe it. So after many Sunday afternoon business
	discussions, it was arranged that he was to take into the business his
	wife&#8217;s cousin, one Lemuel Stucker, who had spent twenty years saving
	$9000 as general manager for a flour and feed concern.</p>

	<p>Stucker had worked out elaborate sets of figures to prove the needed
	economies of management.</p>

	<p>He was so tireless and sincere, so careful and exact, that it was with
	a great sense of relief that Sam turned the store over to him.</p>

	<p>Here, at last, was a man who could lift from his shoulders the daily
	burden of management.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page25" title="25"></a>Sam&#8217;s real interest in the change, as those who knew him might have
	guessed, was a desire for new enterprise. He had long had an eye on a
	fine opening for a clothing store in the neighboring town of
	Bridgeville, twenty miles away, and he lost no time in carrying out
	this project.</p>

	<p>During the ensuing year he was so engrossed with the Bridgeville
	branch that Medeena rarely saw him, and Lemuel Stucker&#8217;s rather
	discouraging reports on the state of business were attributed to Lem&#8217;s
	conservatism and natural depression of mind.</p>

	<p>Lem was Sam&#8217;s opposite in almost every particular. A small, sallow man
	with a black <a class="pagenum" id="page26" title="26"></a>shoe-string necktie and a look of general regret.</p>

	<p>He spent most of his time untying knots in pieces of string, picking
	up bits of wrapping paper and sharpening short lead-pencils, and he
	was great on buying brooms.</p>

	<p>His effect on the store was one of immediate and prevalent blight.</p>

	<p>You may wonder why the boys did not complain of conditions to Sam, but
	Lem was manager&#8212;and there is something so virtuous and convincing
	about a first-class retrencher. His wise saws and thrifty sayings
	are infectious and he makes everybody so low-spirited that they are
	ready to catch anything.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page27" title="27"></a>No more good window displays&#8212;tacks, colored cheesecloth and other
	accessories cost money, and the sun was bad for the goods.</p>

	<p>No more trim on the counters and shelves.</p>

	<p>Stop the high-power electric light in front of the store and reduce
	the lamps inside.</p>

	<p>These things did not all occur at once, but so gradually that it was
	hard to realize just what had happened to the store.</p>

	<p>The windows got streaky and the inside of the store looked dingy and
	cold.</p>

	<p>Then the conservative spirit got into the buying. Nothing but black
	cheviots with a few drab and gray worsteds.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page28" title="28"></a>Perhaps it was just as well, for when a customer came into the store
	and saw Stucker he thought it was raining outside.</p>

	<p>Sam Lambert had always prided himself on keeping alive what he called
	the &#8220;buying spirit&#8221; in the store.</p>

	<p>Nowadays a customer got a sense of caution. The feeling was one of
	disapproval of all extravagance.</p>

	<p>Instead of purchasing a suit, the man wondered where his next month&#8217;s
	rent was coming from, bought a pair of cottonade pants and hurried
	home.</p>

	<p>Trade fell off steadily. Affairs went on this way for a twelvemonth
	and then something happened.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page29" title="29"></a>Two of Sam&#8217;s principal competitors were reported to be remodeling
	their stores&#8212;and what was more, they were going to put in wardrobe
	systems and carry all their garments on hangers.</p>

	<p>This aroused Sam and he made an immediate investigation.</p>

	<p>He found that one of the stores had contracted for the old type of
	wooden wall cabinets where the clothes hung behind panelled doors.</p>

	<p>But the other was installing glass wardrobes, where the stock would be
	on view.</p>

	<p>This discovery cut Sam like a knife.</p>

	<p>He investigated further, and was delighted to find that his <a class="pagenum" id="page30" title="30"></a>wardrobe competitor, with the temptation to save a few dollars, had
	ordered a second-rate type of glass wardrobe, with pull-out rods that
	swing inside the case, without a locking device to prevent them from
	breaking the glass.</p>

	<p>Without saying anything to Stucker he telegraphed the best wardrobe
	concern in the country to send their representative at once.</p>

	<h2 id="chapter_iii"><a class="pagenum" id="page31" title="31"></a>CHAPTER III.</h2>

	<p><span class="first_word">At</span> eleven o&#8217;clock the following day a quiet man wearing double-lens
	spectacles and a pre-occupied air came into the store, asked for Mr.
	Lambert and was directed to the rear where Stucker was showing Sam the
	wisdom of leaving the night covers over the black goods during the day
	to protect the stock from dust.</p>

	<p>Sam was so keyed up on the wardrobe question that he heard only about
	half that Stucker was saying.</p>

	<p>When the man with the spectacles arrived Sam guessed <a class="pagenum" id="page32" title="32"></a>his mission without waiting for a word of greeting.</p>

	<p>&#8220;You,&#8221; said Sam, &#8220;are here to talk wardrobes; let&#8217;s see what you&#8217;ve
	got.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Before I talk wardrobes, or, if you please, the New Way system,&#8221;
	began the salesman, &#8220;I would prefer to get a fair idea of the amount
	and kind of stock you carry and how you care for it now.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Just as I thought,&#8221; interrupted Stucker. &#8220;You&#8217;re afraid our stock is
	too big for your wardrobe capacity.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t want to discourage you, but when you count the suits on
	the table, don&#8217;t forget to add about 50 dozen pair of knee pants and
	odd trousers stored in <a class="pagenum" id="page33" title="33"></a>case-goods boxes under the tables.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Remember too, that when you take the tables out, you must find
	another place for our last years sweaters, mufflers, caps, gloves and
	underwear, as well as all our advance stock of shirts, hosiery and
	ties which we keep under the tables because we have no room for them
	on our side shelving. You can see it is piled to the ceiling now; and
	all that on top is active stock.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;That reminds me, Mr. Stucker, of a joke your friend Jones, over at
	Dennisville, played on Sakes, his partner.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Before we remodelled their store, they had a lot of <a class="pagenum" id="page34" title="34"></a>money tied up in stock piled under the tables like you have. Most of
	it was odds and ends&#8212;left overs of many seasons that Jones knew even
	a clearance sale would not clean up.</p>

	<p>&#8220;He inventoried the lot and shipped 72 dozen pair of knee pants to New
	York, and wrote the auctioneer to send a check for whatever amount
	they brought.</p>

	<p>&#8220;The funny part of it, Sakes never discovered that the stock was gone
	until about three weeks later, when he noticed a check in the mail and
	asked Jones what it was for.</p>

	<p>&#8220;You can do the same thing, Mr. Stucker, with your stock under the
	tables, and the check you will get will <a class="pagenum" id="page35" title="35"></a>help buy New Way sectional shelving that will give you about three
	times the capacity your furnishing department has now; so it will not
	be necessary to climb to the ceiling for your active stock or dig
	under the tables for your out of season goods.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Before we discuss detail, Mr. Lambert,&#8221; continued the salesman, &#8220;I
	have something to say about the practical arrangement of the inside of
	the store.</p>

	<p>&#8220;The business of a store is to sell goods. A customer may come in for
	one item. You want him to buy two or three or a half a dozen. The
	easier you make it for him, the less he has to cross and <a class="pagenum" id="page36" title="36"></a>recross the store to complete his purchases&#8212;the more goods you will
	sell him.</p>

	<p>&#8220;What you want&#8212;what every merchant wants&#8212;and what few have&#8212;is a
	practical, natural selling arrangement of the goods.</p>

	<p>&#8220;The invention of a practical wardrobe merely made the right plan
	possible.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Our business is to suggest the plan and fit the wardrobe arrangement
	to the needs of a store.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Every clothing store has its own individuality. Each problem must be
	worked out on the ground with a full knowledge of the stock and the
	business, the history of the store, the nature of its trade <a class="pagenum" id="page37" title="37"></a>and the personality of its proprietor.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Sam&#8217;s interest was excited. This point of view was new to him, but he
	could see the truth of it and he was impatient to get at the heart of
	the matter as far as his own store was concerned.</p>

	<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re right,&#8221; he said, &#8220;about the personality and individuality of a
	store; and for that reason don&#8217;t tell me to put the furnishing goods
	shelving down the middle of the store. This is a clothing store and
	not a haberdashery.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Mr. Lambert,&#8221; said the salesman, &#8220;you have hit the nail squarely on
	the head. This is a double room, a very different problem from that <a class="pagenum" id="page38" title="38"></a>of a single store. I looked over the place of one of your competitors
	this morning. He also has a double store with much the same
	arrangement as yours and I find that he is making a mistake&#8212;adopting
	a plan that is about five years behind the times.</p>

	<p>&#8220;You see, in the earlier days of the wardrobe, there was no such thing
	as a center wardrobe. Therefore the clothing had to be hung against
	the wall in pull-out cabinets. When the clothing went to the side
	walls the furnishings had to move to the center floor space.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Such an arrangement is not practical for a double store and the
	effect is bad. It kills the first impression of a big <a class="pagenum" id="page39" title="39"></a>store. The shelving will look bare if it is not trimmed, and if it is
	trimmed your big double room looks like two small stores divided by a
	wall.</p>

	<p>&#8220;The center shelving will always have stock boxes piled on top and
	that will throw one side of the store always in shadow. Besides, this
	arrangement divides the trade and screens half of it from view.</p>

	<p>&#8220;The stock is cut in two and looks small.</p>

	<p>&#8220;One salesman can not wait on the furnishing goods trade without
	neglecting half of it all the time. If you have two clerks, a customer
	must be taken from one side to the other for his ties or underwear,
	and there you are again, both <a class="pagenum" id="page40" title="40"></a>on one side at the same time.</p>

	<p>&#8220;If another customer came along they&#8217;d have to stop in the middle of a
	sale and refer him to a clerk around in the other aisle.</p>

	<p>&#8220;A furnishing goods department should be continuous. The sale of a
	shirt will lead to the purchase of a tie or a collar or hosiery. The
	goods should be in sight so that they automatically suggest
	themselves.</p>

	<p>&#8220;You enter this store and the first impression you get is a big
	clothing store. That is what you want. Clothing dominates the store.
	Furnishing goods and hats are important and necessary side lines. No
	one would mistake it for a haberdasher&#8217;s. You <a class="pagenum" id="page41" title="41"></a>have been known from the beginning as the leading clothier. That&#8217;s the
	reputation you want to keep.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Mr. Lambert, one of the important problems of this store is to house
	your stock in new fixtures and at the same time widen your aisles.</p>

	<p>&#8220;You can not see how that is possible. It is really the only problem I
	have to solve for you, and it is easy.&#8221;</p>

	<p>The little man with the big spectacles had things moving. He was not
	much of a salesman but he knew all about merchandising in a retail
	store.</p>

	<p>And he certainly was familiar with every store fixture and selling
	device that had ever been invented, its good and <a class="pagenum" id="page42" title="42"></a>bad points, where it was practical and where it was not.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Before a merchant puts money into store equipment&#8221;, said the wardrobe
	man, &#8220;he ought to be sure that he is getting the very latest and most
	improved models. He owes this to himself as a protection for his
	investment.</p>

	<p>&#8220;There is always a temptation to save a few dollars by adopting a poor
	imitation or some out-of-date device.</p>

	<p>&#8220;The latest and best is the cheapest in the end, especially when you
	consider convenience and durability.</p>

	<p>&#8220;A pretty safe guide is to see what the biggest and best stores
	everywhere are installing today.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page43" title="43"></a>&#8220;You will find such merchants as John Wanamaker in his Philadelphia
	and New York stores equipping his clothing departments solely with New
	Way Crystal Wardrobes;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Browning, King &amp; Company in seventeen cities;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Schuman, Kennedy, Posner, Talbot Company, Jordan-Marsh &amp; Company,
	Leopold Morse Company, McCullough &amp; Parker in Boston;</p>

	<p>&#8220;George Muse Company in Atlanta;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Mullen &amp; Bluett of Los Angeles;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Becker of San Francisco;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Burkhardt of Cincinnati;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Lazarus, and Meyer Israel of New Orleans;</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page44" title="44"></a>&#8220;And more than a thousand others&#8212;all the representative stores of
	their localities.</p>

	<p>&#8220;These men have selected the New Way Crystal Wardrobes after careful
	comparison with every other device on the market.</p>

	<p>&#8220;They have found the New Way Crystal Wardrobe the most sightly and
	compact&#8212;having the largest capacity with the greatest ease of
	operation.</p>

	<p>&#8220;They find that they show the goods better; that the clerks can work
	faster from them; that half a dozen clerks can sell from one wardrobe
	at the same time; that one boy can keep the stock in good shape where
	four were <a class="pagenum" id="page45" title="45"></a>inadequate under any other plan.</p>

	<p>&#8220;They find that the New Way people have basic patents on special
	features, such as the New Way disappearing doors that divide in the
	center, and slide into the ends of the wardrobe and do not project
	into the aisle.</p>

	<p>&#8220;The New Way revolving rack with the patent locking device, which
	works loaded or unloaded with equal ease&#8212;no friction, no leverage, no
	noise.</p>

	<p>&#8220;They find the New Way low center wardrobes give an unobstructed view
	all over the store and are the only wardrobes made that are entirely
	practical for grouping in front <a class="pagenum" id="page46" title="46"></a>of a furnishing or hat department.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Likewise the high double deck wall wardrobes have more than double
	the capacity of tables.&#8221;</p>

	<p>The wardrobe man illustrated his talk with photographs and backed his
	arguments with figures.</p>

	<p>The upshot of it was that he made a complete ground plan of the
	Lambert store with a modern selling arrangement and New Way fixtures
	in their proper places.</p>

	<p>But before Stucker would admit the wisdom of the improvement, he
	argued it from every point of view.</p>

	<p>&#8220;The farmer trade,&#8221; he said, &#8220;would imagine that they <a class="pagenum" id="page47" title="47"></a>would have to pay higher prices for clothing to make up the cost of
	new fixtures.&#8221;</p>

	<p>This, mind you, today when the farmer is the most enlightened member
	of the community&#8212;when he is using progressive methods in marketing
	his own product, to reduce his costs and increase his profits!</p>

	<p>Lem acknowledged that the clothiers who are handling the finest
	merchandise are fitting up their stores with New Way Crystal
	Wardrobes, and he didn&#8217;t like to admit that the Lambert Store didn&#8217;t
	sell high grade merchandise.</p>

	<p>He conceded that fine goods in every other line of <a class="pagenum" id="page48" title="48"></a>trade are treated with the care and respect they deserve, otherwise
	they would suffer in the handling and cease to be fine merchandise.</p>

	<p>Finally, Lem admitted that the discerning public does judge a
	merchant&#8217;s stock by the way he treats it, so that the store with New
	Way Wardrobes as a feature is not only the most progressive store, but
	in practically every instance the most prosperous in the clothing
	trade of its locality.</p>

	<p>After Sam had given the order his one thought was impatience for the
	completion of the job.</p>

	<p>&#8220;I must have that stuff all installed so that I can have <a class="pagenum" id="page49" title="49"></a>my opening a week ahead of the other people.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Here, Stucker,&#8221; called Sam to that gloomy soul, who had gone behind a
	stock of work-shirts, while the order was being signed, &#8220;we&#8217;ll let you
	dispose of the old fixtures. That&#8217;s a job that&#8217;s just about your size.</p>

	<p>&#8220;I tell you, Stucker, a natural-born retrencher has his virtues. But
	if you give him rope enough he will retrench you out of business. He
	never builds anything. If it wasn&#8217;t for the creative man there would
	be nothing to retrench.</p>

	<p>&#8220;The retrencher is all right if you don&#8217;t pay him too much. He is
	worth about <a class="pagenum" id="page50" title="50"></a>$10 a month, because you can find fifty of them in any old man&#8217;s home
	that you can hire for less money than that.</p>

	<p>&#8220;No, Lem, I won&#8217;t be unfair. You&#8217;re not as bad as all that. It takes
	all kinds of people to make a world and there is plenty of room for
	both of us in this business&#8212;there always will be leaks to stop and
	work to do for an earnest man who has the interest of the store at
	heart.</p>

	<p>&#8220;The fault has been in the division of our labor. I&#8217;ll show you the
	way we can get the best out of ourselves.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Sam,&#8221; said Lem, &#8220;I reckon I&#8217;ve been looking at the world through a
	crack in the fence and I&#8217;ll have to widen <a class="pagenum" id="page51" title="51"></a>out my view a little. You give me the books and the sales slips to
	look after. In the meantime I&#8217;m going to make the most exact inventory
	this store ever had and be ready to check in the fresh stock that is
	to go in these New Way wardrobes.</p>

	<p>&#8220;My talents are all right if I don&#8217;t try to cover too much territory.&#8221;</p>

	<p>The two men shook hands.</p>

	<p>All was in readiness on the day set. Everybody in Medeena County came
	to the Grand Opening, and Sam Lambert&#8217;s New Way Store is doing the
	business of the town.</p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
